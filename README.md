## Caveats and Limitations

### Simulation Nature
- **This is NOT a real implementation**: This framework simulates agent behavior using mathematical models and random distributions, not actual LLM agents
- **No actual agent communication**: "Agents" are data structures with hardware specifications; "task execution" uses `np.random.normal()` to simulate costs and times
- **Theoretical validation only**: Results validate the mathematical framework and decision algorithms, not real-world agent interactions
- **Mock market dynamics**: Supply, demand, and pricing variations are generated using statistical distributions, not actual market forces

### Simulation Constraints
- **Restrictive Decision Thresholds**: High TOPSIS thresholds (>0.6), confidence requirements (>0.8), or skill compatibility thresholds (>0.7) may prevent outsourcing entirely, resulting in 0% metrics across all performance indicators
- **Market Size Dependencies**: Performance varies significantly with agent population - small markets (5 agents) may show super-efficiency effects while large markets (50+ agents) exhibit realistic diseconomies of scale
- **Duration Sensitivity**: Short simulations (<7 days) may not capture market equilibrium effects, while very long simulations (>30 days) may show diminishing returns

### Data Interpretation
- **Zero-Value Results**: Experiments showing 0.0% across all metrics typically indicate no outsourcing occurred due to restrictive parameters rather than system failure
- **Super-Efficiency Anomalies**: Cost reductions >100% in small-scale scenarios reflect idealized market conditions and should be interpreted as theoretical upper bounds
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: The Œµ=0.1 exploration rate may cause temporary performance degradation as the system learns optimal contractor relationships

### Real-World Applicability
- **Simplified Cost Models**: The simulation uses idealized cost calculations that may not reflect real-world complexity, network latency, or integration overhead
- **Perfect Information Assumption**: Agents have complete visibility into contractor capabilities, which may not hold in practice
- **Static Agent Behavior**: Contractor agents maintain consistent performance profiles without learning or adaptation over time

### Technical Limitations
- **Computational Scalability**: Large-scale simulations (>100 agents, >30 days) may require significant computational resources
- **Random Seed Sensitivity**: Results may vary between runs when random_seed is null; use fixed seeds for reproducible experiments
- **Configuration Dependencies**: Performance heavily depends on parameter tuning - default values may not be optimal for all research scenarios
